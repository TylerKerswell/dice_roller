# NW_Hacks2026_Project
**Dice Dungeon** is a 2D dice-based roguelike game developed for **nwHacks 2026** at the University of British Columbia.
Players progress through a dungeon by rolling and strategically selecting dice to defeat enemies, manage risk, and survive increasingly difficult floors.

The game blends chance and decision-making: while dice rolls introduce randomness, players can choose how to use their dice, reroll at a cost, and adapt their strategy based on enemy intent and limited resources. Each run is short, replayable, and designed to reward thoughtful risk-taking.

Built as a hackathon prototype, Dice Dungeon focuses on clean gameplay mechanics, clarity, and fast iteration rather than complex visuals.

##Key Features
